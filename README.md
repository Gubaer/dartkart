# dartkart

_dartkart_ is  framwork for web cartografy in the tradition of the
JavaScript libraries [OpenLayers](http://www.openlayers.org) and 
[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/). It is neither a 1:1 port of 
them nor does it provide the full functionality of either of them, 
but it has a similar structure and borrows a lot of ideas from them.
